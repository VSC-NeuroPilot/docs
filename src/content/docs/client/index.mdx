This is the UI/client-side extension version of the documentation, which connects directly to the Neuro API and is the "VS Code interface" for Neuro.

<Aside type="note">

We recently migrated our extension namespace from `pasu4` to `vsc-neuropilot`, and the extension ID from `neuropilot` to `neuropilot-base`.
Please uninstall `pasu4.neuropilot`, as all updates will be published to `vsc-neuropilot.neuropilot-base`.

This applies to both VS Marketplace and Open VSX (even though there weren't many install on Open VSX in the first place).

`pasu4.neuropilot` is being kept around for historical reasons on VS Marketplace. All versions prior to v2.1.0 are published exclusively on that namespace on VS Marketplace.
