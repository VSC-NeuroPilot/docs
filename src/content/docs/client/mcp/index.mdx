This page details compatibility information with MCP servers.
You can also track progress at [this issue](https://github.com/VSC-NeuroPilot/neuropilot-base/issue/79) and any PRs mentioning it.

## Externally

We are in the process of introducing experimental support for external MCP servers. As of last updated, these have the following limitations:

- Only the desktop build is guaranteed to work. The web build may be bugged due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies preventing such use.
- Neuro can only access one MCP server at a time.
- The extension supports only Streamable HTTP servers. Legacy SSE and stdio-based server support are planned.
- The extension will *not* automatically strip out unsupported schema items for each tool.

This feature uses the [TypeScript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).

## Tools activated in VS Code

Currently, Neuro cannot access tools registered by MCP servers or other extensions in VS Code.
Support for this is planned once external MCP server support is out of experimental phase.

## Outside VS Code

If you would like to use MCP outside of VS Code, please use [NeuroMCP](https://github.com/ECHO-HELLO-WORLD424/NeuroMCP).
