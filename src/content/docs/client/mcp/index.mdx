description: Compatibility info with MCP servers

Currently, Neuro has **no** MCP server access. This means that she will be unable to use any MCP servers connected.

Plans to integrate MCP server functionality is being tracked at [issue #79](https://github.com/VSC-NeuroPilot/neuropilot/issue/79).

We are also exploring potentially allowing GitHub Copilot itself to control VS Code via this extension, instead of just via Agent mode.
This is likely going to be implemented using the MCP protocol and is being tracked at [issue #80](https://github.com/VSC-NeuroPilot).
Note that this is *not* a guarantee and is considered to be on the side comparatively, and may end up being in a separate extension.
