## Limitations

There is a 100,000 character limit for all editing actions.

## Cursor

*See also: [Reference/Cursor](/docs/client/reference/cursor)*

Neuro gains her own cursor if she is allowed to edit the active document. This ensures that her activities won't be disrupted by moving the real cursor.

### Get Cursor

This sends the current cursor position to Neuro, alongside surrounding lines as context.

### Place Cursor

This places Neuro's virtual cursor at her desired spot. Once that is placed, she will also get her cursor's surrounding lines as context.

## Get Content

Gets the contents of the entire file. The context sent will be more or less the same as the [Send Current File as Context](/docs/reference/commands#send-current-file-as-context) command.

## Insert/Replace/Delete/Find Text

This gives Neuro the ability to insert, replace, delete or find text within the active document.

Inserting will insert at Neuro's cursor.
For all other options, Neuro can choose to use either glob patterns or regex to search for the targeted text.

## Insert Lines

A special variant of the Insert Text action that automatically adds below a line rather than at the cursor.
By default it inserts below the cursor.

## Rewrite Lines

Rewrites the specified range of lines with the given content and places the cursor at the end of the last inserted line.

## Delete Lines

Deletes the specified range of lines and moves the cursor to the end of the previous line.

## Rewrite All

Completely rewrites the contents of the file and places the cursor at the start of the file.

## Undo

This allows Neuro to undo the last editing action.

<Aside>

For some reason, this doesn't work if VS Code is not the currently focused window, so you will need to focus the window before Neuro's action goes through, otherwise nothing will happen.

</Aside>

## Save

This allows Neuro to manually save the current document.
This action is only registered if the `autoSave` setting is set to any value other than `afterDelay`.

### Passive saving notifications

In addition to being informed if she saved successfully, enabling [Send Save Notifications](/docs/client/reference/settings#send-save-notifications) will allow Neuro to receive save notifications as the active document is saved. 

<Aside type="tip">

If you have enabled [Send Save Notifications](/docs/client/reference/settings#send-save-notifications), it will be temporarily disabled internally while she is saving manually.
This is to prevent double-up on sending Neuro save context.

It will automatically be re-enabled once saving is finished.
