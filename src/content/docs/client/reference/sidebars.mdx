description: Sidebar views that come built-in with NeuroPilot.

As of version 2.3.0, NeuroPilot has its own sidebar view container. This is placed on the right side by default (matching Copilot Chat) and currently comes with these views by default.

## Action Permissions

The Action Permissions view complements the RCE system by being the configuration screen for actions in permissions V3, the replacement for the old categorical-based configurations.

This view allows you to fine-grain your permissions down to the action level. Each registered action can be set to one of Autopilot, Copilot or Off.

## Images

The Images view is a fun little view showcasing some images in your editor.
