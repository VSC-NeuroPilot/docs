To get started on NeuroPilot, [install it from the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pasu4.neuropilot).

Upon installation (and subsequently activation), NeuroPilot will try to seek out the Neuro Game API server. For this reason, you may receive a VS Code about success/failure to connect to the Neuro API.

If you don't have the Neuro API on the default host + port, you can change it in [`Neuropilot > Websocket Url`](/neuropilot/reference/settings#websocketUrl) and attempt to reconnect using the [`NeuroPilot: Reconnect`](/neuropilot/reference/commands#reconnect) command.
You can also use the reconnect command if you didn't get the API ready in time.

By default, NeuroPilot will register its game as `Visual Studio Code`, the initial context will be set to `You are using an extension in Visual Studio Code that allows you to code together with Vedal.`, and the only command registered will be [`request_cookie`](/neuropilot/reference/permissions#requestCookies).
The [game name](/neuropilot/reference/settings#gameName) and [initial context](/neuropilot/reference/settings#initialContext) can also be changed in their respective settings.

Once you've verified that a connection is established, you'll want to configure Neuro's [display name](/neuropilot/reference/settings#currentlyAsNeuroAPI) (if necessary) and [permissions](/neuropilot/reference/permissions). These change the display name of Neuro around the UI and give her the ability to autonomously perform actions, respectively.
