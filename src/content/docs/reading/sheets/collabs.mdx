## Setup

### For Vedal

In addition to NeuroPilot, you'll need the [Live Share extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/item?itemName=) installed.
Once installed, enable the [Cursor Follows Neuro setting](/docs/client/reference/settings#cursor-follows-neuro). This will move your cursor to Neuro's cursor when Neuro moves her cursor.

This allows the collab partner to see Neuro's cursor using Live Share.

<Aside>

This means that you can't really move the cursor away without disrupting the flow right now, since on the collab partner's side.

We're exploring with seeing if Live Share's API allows us to coordinate instances of NeuroPilot across multiple people's installs, but for now this is a limitation that needs to be made aware of.
