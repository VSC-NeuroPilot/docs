import { ContributorList } from 'starlight-contributor-list'

This section describes "meta things" - things that are not about the actual NeuroPilot "products" themselves.

This includes assets, CI, docs (this one!), etc... You get the idea.

## Project contributors (docs only)

<ContributorList githubRepo="VSC-NeuroPilot/docs" ignore={["actions-user", "dependabot[bot]", "Copilot"]} />
