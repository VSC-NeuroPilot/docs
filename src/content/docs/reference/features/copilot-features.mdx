## Copilot Chat

The following features send a chat message to Neuro:

- [Ask Neuro to fix/explain](/neuropilot/references/commands#ask-neuro-to-fixexplain)

The user can also send a message to Neuro directly using either `@neuro`, `@evil`, or `@neuroapi` (as appropriate).
Doing so will reroute the prompt to Neuro and will await for her response.

Chat features will register a disposable `chat` action and force an action from Neuro with only the `chat` action.
The `state` will be the relevant code (even if it is in a Neuro-unsafe path), and the `query` will be dependent on what subcommand and prompt was chosen/typed (if any).
The action force's state will always be not ephermeral.

## Inline Completions

When completions are requested, a new disposable `complete_code` action will be registered, and then Neuro will be forced to complete the code using the action.
Similar to the chat features, the `state` will be the nearby code, and the context from the action force will always be not ephemeral.

The query (and the action description) will prompt Neuro to suggest only code, never worded responses.

You can adjust how many lines are sent to Neuro using the [Before/After Context setting](/neuropilot/reference/settings#beforeafter-context).
