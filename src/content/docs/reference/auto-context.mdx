title: Passive context
description: Feature list that sends Neuro context messages autonomously
---

Certain features allow Neuro to be notified of updates within the workspace, without requiring input from Neuro.
The list of passive context features include:

- Saving notifications (configurable via [this setting](/neuropilot/reference/settings#send-save-notifications)).
- Auto-Save setting modification.
- Linting problems that appear automatically (configurable via [this setting](/neuropilot/reference/settings#send-new-linting-problems-on)).
- Timed out Copilot requests.
- Sending output from terminals to Neuro if they produce more output.
- Finished/exited tasks/terminals.
- Rating Neuro's answer when using chat features.

These will be sent whenever appropriate, and will stack on top of each other.
If you have set up a testing script that mocks the Neuro API server, be aware that these may interfere with detection, especially when dealing with Copilot mode testing.
