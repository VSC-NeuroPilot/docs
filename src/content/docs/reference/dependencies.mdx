title: Extension dependencies
description: To power some of its functionality, NeuroPilot requires some extensions to be loaded to function. This is called a dependency.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Multiple features require another extension to work, so this page lists them so that you are sure you have the necessary extensions to function.

## Direct dependencies

### Visual Studio Code

Don't think this one needs to be explained, but there is one thing: While no guarantees it will work, you can try using a VS Code fork if you want (such as Cursor or VSCodium).

### Copilot Chat

ID: `github.copilot-chat`

*Required: false*

Copilot Chat allows the user to chat with Neuro on the sidebar panel.
It also powers inline completions, allowing Neuro to "complete the code".

<Aside>

You do not require a Copilot Chat subscription to use the chat panel.

</Aside>

### Git

ID: `vscode.git`

*Required: true*

*Built-in extension*

The built-in Git extension powers Neuro's ability to interact with the git repository.

<Aside type="tip">

Despite also having Git in its name, the built-in Git Base extension is not needed to run NeuroPilot.

</Aside>

## Indirect dependencies

### Language servers

*Powers: Linting Analysis*

Language server extensions contribute to the Linting Analysis portion indirectly by contributing to VSCode's linting diagnostics feature.

### Shells

*Powers: Terminal*

To use the terminal feature, you are required to have installed shells on your computer.
