**For simplicity, all mentions of Neuro in these docs also apply to Evil unless otherwise stated.**

<Aside type="danger">

Depending on the permissions you activate and which of the aforementioned testing tools / AIs you use, this extension can be quite destructive to your system.
No contributors or collaborators on this project take responsibility for any harm done to your system as a result of this extension.
Use Copilot mode for dangerous permissions or use the extension on a virtual machine.

</Aside>

## Terminology

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Neuro-safe/Neuro-unsafe">
		A set of directories Neuro is/isn't allowed to access.

    To find out about what directories are included, see [the File access restrictions section on the safety page](/neuropilot/reference/safety#file-access-restrictions).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Autopilot/Copilot">
		Two modes you can set permissions to, allowing more controlled behaviour from the extension.

    For more info, see [the guides page on selecting a -pilot mode for a setting](/neuropilot/guides/pilot).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Passive/Background/Auto context">
		Context that is sent to Neuro passively. This is done with a small amount of features.

    You can learn more and find the list [here](/neuropilot/reference/auto-context).
