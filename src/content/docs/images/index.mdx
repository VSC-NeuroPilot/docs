[KTrain5369](https://ktrain5369.dev/) maintains a set of Docker/GitHub Codespaces containers with preset tools and configurations for optimal use with NeuroPilot.
This allows for quick-starting a project of that language and skip the worry of installing the tools you need, while also allowing for a sandbox environment to ensure that the host machine isn't compromised.
