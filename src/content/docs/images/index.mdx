[KTrain5369](https://ktrain5369.dev/) maintains a set of Docker/GitHub Codespaces containers with preset tools and configurations for optimal use with NeuroPilot.
This allows for quick-starting a project of that language and skip the worry of installing the tools you need, while also allowing for a sandbox environment to ensure that the host machine isn't compromised.

Containers are hosted on `ghcr.io/vsc-neuropilot`. You can access a certain container using the following syntax:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Latest"><Code code="https://ghcr.io/vsc-neuropilot/{repository}:latest" lang="sh" mark={[":latest"]} />This will pull the latest commit version, not the latest tag.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Tagged version"><Code code="https://ghcr.io/vsc-neuropilot/{repository}:{tag}" lang="sh" mark={[":{tag}"]} />Note that not all NeuroPilot versions will have a container version attached.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Git SHA pin"><Code code="https://ghcr.io/vsc-neuropilot/{repository}:{sha}" lang="sh" mark={[":{sha}"]} />Failed builds will not have an associated SHA URL.</TabItem>
    <TabItem label="SHA-256 digest"><Code code="https://ghcr.io/vsc-neuropilot/{repository}@sha256:{sha}" lang="sh" mark={["@sha256:{sha}"]} />You can get the SHA-256 digest on the container's GitHub Packages listing.</TabItem>
</Tabs>

All images come with the relevant Neuro Game SDK package specified as a dependency, as well as some starter code.

If you would not like to make SDK integrations, you are free to remove the package and the relevant code.
